# Udacity React MyReads: A Book Tracking App

## Description
A React app that allows users to organize and track books. This is project number six in Udacity's Front End Nanodegree curriculum and uses an API to populate books based on user input. 

### How to get up and running
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Find the `package.json` file and look under dependencies and npm install them all.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server and launch the app.


### How to use the app
You have three rows: want to read, currently reading, and read. You can sort books among these three categories - as well as remove them - using the green arrow located on the bottom right of each book. You can also search for new books to add to one of these lists using the search bar at the top.
